# Hello-world
I'll start learning GitHub now. Cool!

It seems very effective to use GitHub for cooperative projects. I am just get started. Hope to learn this technical tool soon!

Besides, I also want/plan to learn Machine Learning, Python, and VBA. I want to improve my technical toolbox so that I can effectively work as a financial analyst.

I now realize that I may need to use # to sart a section. Let's test it!
